# This is my practice / testing for work
A list of things I want to do:
1)  Slack messages from Star Utility to specific channel
2)  Change Access / Voice Vlans on switchports from app or web interface
3)  Switch programability with minimal input (verify responses, standard config)
4)  Voice gateway call status identifying call legs
